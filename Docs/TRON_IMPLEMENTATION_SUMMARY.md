# Tron Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented Tron blockchain monitoring in the wallet-watcher application. This implementation allows tracking of both native TRX transfers and TRC20 token transfers using a polling-based approach, as Tron doesn't support WebSockets like EVM chains.

## Components Implemented

1. **Configuration**
   - Updated `config.ts` to include Tron network configuration
   - Added support for TronGrid API URL and API key

2. **Token Service**
   - Extended `TokenMetadata` interface to include Tron addresses
   - Added `getTronTokens()` method to retrieve Tron-specific tokens

3. **Balance Service**
   - Added support for Tron address format detection
   - Implemented `fetchTronNativeBalance()` to get TRX balances
   - Implemented `fetchTronTokenBalances()` to get TRC20 token balances
   - Updated `getTotalBalance()` to handle both EVM and Tron addresses

4. **Tron Connection Manager**
   - Implemented polling mechanism for native TRX transfers (every 3 seconds)
   - Implemented polling for TRC20 token transfers (every 10 seconds)
   - Added batch processing of addresses to respect API rate limits
   - Implemented proper error handling and circuit breaker pattern
   - Added conversion between EVM and Tron address formats

5. **Testing Tools**
   - Created `test-tron.ts` script to test the Tron monitoring
   - Created `add-trx-token.ts` script to add TRX and USDT tokens to the database
   - Added documentation in `README_TRON.md`

## API Usage Optimization

The implementation is optimized to stay within API provider limits (e.g., TronGrid's 100,000 API calls per day, TronScan policies may vary but should be respected).

1. **Timestamp-Based Filtering**
   - Native TRX: Fetches blocks incrementally using `lastProcessedBlockNumber`.
   - TRC20 Tokens: Fetches transfers for each tracked token contract using `start_timestamp` (last processed timestamp for that specific token contract) to get only new records.

2. **Efficient Polling Strategy for TRC20 Tokens**
   - Instead of polling per tracked wallet address (which would be `W` API calls per cycle), polling is done **per tracked TRC20 token contract address** (e.g., 3 tokens).
   - For each of these token contracts, all recent transfers are fetched.
   - **Client-Side Filtering:** The returned transfers are then filtered client-side by checking if the `from_address` or `to_address` exists in the (potentially very large) set of `W` tracked wallet addresses. This is done efficiently using a JavaScript `Set` for lookups.
   - This dramatically reduces API calls for TRC20 monitoring, making it independent of `W`.

3. **Batched Processing (Native TRX)**
   - Processes new blocks in batches (e.g., up to 10 per cycle) to manage the duration of each polling operation.

4. **Separate Polling Intervals & Estimated API Calls**
   - Native TRX (Block Polling): e.g., Every 5-10 seconds. If 10s, for polling current block: `(6 * 60 * 24) = 8,640 calls/day`. For fetching new blocks (e.g., 20 blocks/minute): `(20 * 60 * 24) = 28,800 calls/day`. Total native ~37,440 (example).
   - TRC20 Token Transfers (Per Tracked Token): e.g., For 3 tracked tokens, polling each every 5 minutes: `3 tokens * (24 * 60 / 5) calls_per_token/day = 3 * 288 = 864 calls/day`.
   - **Total Estimated (Example):** ~38,304 calls/day. This is significantly better than `W * polling_cycles` and should be well within typical free tier limits.

5. **Smart Error Handling**
   - Implements exponential backoff for API failures
   - Pauses polling after consecutive failures
   - Logs detailed error information for debugging

## Integration with Existing System

The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing wallet-watcher architecture:

1. Uses the same `AddressManager` for tracking addresses
2. Emits the same `UnifiedTransferEvent` format as EVM chains
3. Uses the same `NotificationService` for alerts
4. Maintains consistent logging format

## How to Use

1. Configure Tron API settings in `.env`:
   ```
   TRONGRID_API_URL=https://api.trongrid.io
   TRONGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Add Tron tokens to the database using the provided script:
   ```
   npx ts-node src/add-trx-token.ts
   ```

3. Start the application with Tron monitoring enabled:
   ```
   // In your main application code
   const wsManager = new WsConnectionManager(5, 'tron');
   wsManager.setEventHandler(handleTransferEvent);
   await wsManager.startConnections();
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. Add support for TRC10 tokens
2. Implement webhook support for real-time notifications
3. Add support for running a full Tron node for better reliability
4. Implement historical transaction sync capabilities
