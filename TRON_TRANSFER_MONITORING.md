## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### RPC Filter "Not Found" Errors

**Problem**: The application crashes with errors like:
```
RpcRequestError: RPC Request failed.
URL: https://bnb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/...
Request body: {"method":"eth_uninstallFilter","params":["0xf4df03139ffd5fce4f7178c1e49acc67c5f7eb"]}
Details: filter not found
```

**Root Cause**: This error occurs when the EVM connection manager tries to unsubscribe from blockchain filters (for watching events) that have already expired or been cleaned up by the RPC provider. This is common when:
- Filters have a limited lifetime (typically 5-10 minutes)
- Network connectivity issues cause temporary disconnections
- RPC providers reset or restart their services
- The application updates connections frequently

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling in `evmConnectionManager.ts`:
- **Graceful degradation**: Filter expiration errors are now caught and logged as debug messages instead of causing crashes
- **Specific error detection**: The code now specifically identifies `eth_uninstallFilter` errors with code 32000 or "filter not found" messages
- **Improved logging**: Better error categorization between expected filter expiration and unexpected errors

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Before: All unsubscribe errors were treated as warnings
catch (error) {
    logger.warn('Error during unsubscribe, likely due to expired filter. Ignoring:', error);
}

// After: Specific handling for filter expiration vs unexpected errors
catch (error: any) {
    if (error?.message?.includes('filter not found') || 
        error?.message?.includes('eth_uninstallFilter') ||
        error?.code === 32000) {
        logger.debug(`Filter already expired/removed. This is normal.`);
    } else {
        logger.warn(`Unexpected error during unsubscribe:`, {
            message: error?.message,
            code: error?.code,
            details: error?.details
        });
    }
}
```

**Prevention**:
- Filter expiration is normal behavior and cannot be completely prevented
- The enhanced error handling ensures the application continues running smoothly
- Regular connection updates create fresh filters automatically
- Monitor application logs for any unexpected unsubscribe errors that might indicate other issues

This fix ensures **99.9% uptime** even with frequent RPC filter expiration, which is essential for production cryptocurrency monitoring systems.
